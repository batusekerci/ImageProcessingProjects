In this project,  Floyd-Steinberg Dithering Algorithm is implemented and analyzed its results by comparing them with the quantized images without dithering.

Additionally, colorTransfer is a method that transfers color characteristics of an image to another. It is implemented regarding to one of the early study in this area, 
"Reinhard". The method consists of asimple statistical analysis.
